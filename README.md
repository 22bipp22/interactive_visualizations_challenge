Visualizations of belly button biodiversity
This is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The visualizations included:
A horizontal bar chart to show the top 10 microbes of the selected test subject.
A bubble chart to show all microbes found in the selected subject.
A gauge chart to show how often the selected subject washes thier bellybutton.
